Introduction and Purpose of the RFA
IntraHealth International is an independent nonprofit corporation
affiliated with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
IntraHealth has earned an international reputation for innovative
performance improvement and training activities that benefit a wide
variety of providers in such areas as family planning, reproductive
health, and safe motherhood. 
PRIME II is a global reproductive health project sponsored by the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID). A consortium of 7
international agencies implements the project with IntraHealth
International Inc. as the lead. Partners include Abt Associates,
EngenderHealth, PATH, Training Resources Group, American College of
Nurse Midwives and Save the Children. PRIME II currently works with the
government of Armenia to expand access to quality reproductive health
services at the primary level through development of updated national
policies and protocols and through pilot implementation of those new
approaches in Lori Marz. PRIME II's Human Immunodeficiency
Virus/Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) project supports the
government of Armenia to strengthen its efforts to prevent further
spread of STIs in the population through preparing primary care
providers to offer integrated STI management and prevention services and
by educating communities around those primary care centers about
services and appropriate prevention practices. Since May, 2003 STI
Syndromic Management Guidelines and Algorithms were developed in close
collaboration with the Center of Dermatology, STIs and AIDS Prevention
and the Ministry of Health, RA. As part of an overall program aimed at
improving health services in sexually transmitted infection treatment
and prevention at the primary health care level, PRIME II has conducted
a Training of Trainers in STI Syndromic Management, based on the
above-mentioned guidelines. Participants who have undergone this
training will be responsible for conducting training of primary care
providers in selected primary care sites in Lori Marz. This Request for
Applications (RFA) invites applications on the implementation of a
community-based intervention to conduct community education campaign to
prevent/combat HIV/STI among community inhabitants in Lori Marz. The
applications are limited to local Armenian Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) for projects of up to 6 months of duration to
provide informative/counseling/referral and other educational services
to the target community members. 
IntraHealth will be the entity awarding the subcontracts. The
subcontracts may be awarded to one or more Armenian NGOs who have proven
capability to carry out successful activities in the field of public
health and/or education. Awards will average $10,000 with a maximum of
$12,000 (Documented in-kind contributions are strongly encouraged).
The purpose of this program is to raise awareness and knowledge of the
population in issues related to the HIV/STI in professionally-accurate
and culturally-appropriate ways and to mobilize actions to tackle
HIV/STI. The program aims:
-  to increase the awareness of the link between STIs and HIV/AIDS, 
-  to demystify and destigmatize these diseases, to combat the myths and
taboos associates with them,
-  to promote prevention activities and practices,
-  to increase use of services for treatment of STIs. 
An important emphasis of the program is to provide referrals for
counseling and STI care management to the primary health care providers,
already trained by PRIME II in STI integrated care management.
On February 24th, 2004 IntraHealth will hold a meeting to review the
RFA, answer questions as appropriate related to the RFA and provide
guidance on the format of application. All prospective applicants are

NGO Training on the Framework Convention for the Protection of,Minority Rights Group International,"Strasbourg, France 
DESCRIPTION:   As part of ongoing work on the Framework Convention for
the Protection of National Minorities, Minority Rights Group
International is organising a Training on the Framework Convention for
the Protection of National Minorities. The training is organised in
cooperation with the FCNM Secretariat of the Directorate General of
Human Rights of the Council of Europe, and will be held in Strasbourg
from 27th to 30th May 2004. The training is for minority based and
interethnic human rights NGOs from countries whose state reports are due
in 2004 only. The training is open to NGOs from Armenia, Austria,
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Romania,
Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain,
Ukraine, and United Kingdom. The training is also open to NGOs from
Kosovo. 
The objectives of the training will be to: 
- Provide information on the content of the Framework Convention and its
monitoring mechanism; 
- Identify ways in which NGOs can best contribute to the monitoring of
the implementation of the Convention, both at the domestic level and at
the level of the Council of Europe; 
- Provide opportunities for participating NGOs to make contact with
other NGOs working on minority protection, Council of Europe staff,
members of the treaty monitoring body, and their government
representatives to the Council of Europe; and 
- Develop follow-up activities, focusing on involvement in state
reporting process, producing shadow reports, and related advocacy. 
The programme will include presentations, case studies, discussions,
small group and individual work. It will include an overview of
international instruments and mechanisms for minority protection,
including in-depth consideration of the Framework Convention, its
monitoring mechanism and opportunities for civil society to contribute.
Methodologies will be participatory and the focus will be on practice.
There will be task groups on the development of NGO advocacy strategies
to contribute to effective monitoring of State compliance and drafting
additional information/shadow reports. 
MRG will invite representatives of 25 NGOs from the target countries
listed above. 
Participants will be selected on the basis of their organisations'
institutional capacity and commitment to raise awareness of minority
rights and monitor implementation of international instruments,
specifically the Framework Convention, and their own professional
experience. 
Priority will be given to NGOs who: 
- Prioritise advocacy for protection of minority rights (international
experience is not needed, but experience and organisational commitment
to working on minority protection at the domestic level is key) 
- Are interested in producing shadow reports on the Framework Convention
and being involved in the state reporting process. 
NGO representatives applying to the training have to be staff members of
their organisations, and should have: 
- Experience in advocacy work; 
- Commitment to human and minority rights; 
- In-principle support from the management of their organisation to take
forward work on monitoring the Framework Convention; 
- Very good English language skills. Unfortunately, the budget does not
allow for interpretation costs and therefore participants should have
very good English language skills to be able to participate actively in
discussions. 
MRG will aim for a mixture of people from different countries, at least
70% of whom will be from minority communities, and a gender balance. MRG
will select participants on the basis of their application and the above
organisational and professional selection criteria. 
MRG will not select more than one participant from any one organisation.
The training is not open to organisations from which 2 or more persons
have participated in MRG's Strasbourg FCNM training since 2000. Anyone
not sure how many persons from their organisation have participated in
MRG's previous FCNM trainings can contact MRG to double check.

Small Grants Pilot Projects on Human Rights Education,Council of Europe and Budapest European Youth Centre,"Budapest, Hungary
DESCRIPTION:   Financial assistance in support of local pilot projects
is important to the Youth Programme on Human Rights Education because it
will allow for new initiatives to be set up and will motivate supporting
local NGOs and groups to undertake action related to human rights
education with young people. By funding pilot projects on human rights
education through the European Youth Foundation, the Directorate of
Youth and Sport seeks to actively contribute to the inclusion of human
rights education in youth work practice and to encourage innovative
practices and partnerships, both in formal and in non-formal education
contexts. 
The pilot projects will allow for a more visible and direct impact of
the programme at local level. They are a necessary complement to the
rest of the youth programme on human rights education and to the other
activities of the Directorate of Youth and Sport of the Council of
Europe. 
Similarly, the inclusion of pilot projects in the European programme may
serve to give them greater visibility and recognition, as well as
facilitating the development of networks and of opportunities to share
expertise and experiences. This will be done by means of the Directorate
of Youth and Sport publications and web sites. This may be completed by
an evaluation meeting and a publication with examples of good practice
in 2005. 
This financial support to pilot projects should be seen as exceptional
and limited to the duration of the programme. The European funding can
not replace the necessary local and/or national co-funding (in money or
in kind). In this context, the assessment of applications will consider
also the feasibility of the projects. 
Priority for funding will be given to projects which would otherwise be
difficult to start up. Funding will not be given to projects that have
already taken place. 
In order to qualify for support, projects must: 
- Be directly related to young people and to human rights education or
to a specific theme addressed by the programme; 
- Be prepared, run and managed by a local association, institution or
youth group acting directly with children, young people or a specific
target group of the programme; 
- Have a clear educational or awareness-raising function; 
- Concern primarily participants under 30 years of age; 
- Have a participatory approach, from the conception to the evaluation; 
- Integrate intercultural learning in its educational approach; 
- Have an innovative character (in terms of methodology, target groups
addressed, etc.); 
- Be open to other partners of the youth programme on human rights
education and foresee using the resources generated through the
programme (e.g. the Manual on Human Rights Education); 
- Have a clear potential local impact while being open to European
networks; 
- Have a European dimension, either by involving more than one country,
and/or by taking into consideration the European context; 
- Follow the basic educational principles of the Council of Europe's
youth sector. 
Selected projects can be funded up to a maximum of 7.600 Euro.",NA

AGBU London is pleased to host a presentation on poverty in the republic
of
Armenia. The speaker, Onnik Krikorian is a British photojournalist
living in
Armenia for the past five years. He identifies some of the crippling
poverty
and its probably long term consequences in Armenia today. The purpose
of
Krikorian's presentation is to share information, to cultivate a better
understanding of everyday realities in Armenia, and to foster informed
discussions when considering the future of Armenia and Armenians. The
AGBU,
the largest Armenian philanthropic organisation in the world, has a
vested
interest in promoting such understanding of Armenia.
The Armenian Government recently declared a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper
(PRSP) to reduce poverty in Armenia to 20% by 2015. This is  a major
undertaking that merits serious attention and forms the backdrop to our
guest speaker. Krikorian will share his insights through his experience
working with international organizations and NGOs operating in the
Republic,
as well as his every-day interaction with ordinary people in Armenia.
His
talk will be illustrated with probing photographs and commentaries. He
will
also address other related issues such as corruption and the
democraticization process in the Republic of Armenia today.
Finally, Krikorian will present a multimedia CD of his photographs and
articles. This CD project was partly supported by AGBU London and aimed
at
NGOs working in Armenia. Copies will be available at the event.

DETAIL DESCRIPTION:  Media Diversity Institute (MDI) will hold a Team
Reporting Project for broadcast journalists working in Georgia and
Armenia. A team reporting project is a 10 day project designed to bring
cross-ethnic groups of journalists together to work on one topic
extensively during the 10 days. The topic for the project is decided by
the entire team together. The topic will certainly be related to
diversity topics such as ethnic minorities, religious minorities,
disabled people, refugees or IDPs - basically any group that is
generally marginalised by the mainstream media. The journalists produce
TV pieces together in teams and then all pieces are edited and put into
a 30 minute programme which is made available to any TV station free of
charge. A copy will be available to all participants as well. There will
be a local language version of each programme produced. This will be
achieved by proving subtitles or dubbing where necessary.
There will be one team that is made up of 8 TV journalists and two
trainers. 4 journalists will be from Armenia and 4 from Georgia. 
There will be one international and one local trainer working throughout
the project. The project will be held primarily in Russian. 
But pieces will be written in your native language and translated into
the English for editing. They will then be translated into Armenian and
Georgian for the local language production of each programme.
Project format:
The project takes 10 days. It will be primarily based on one country. In
this case the base is Yerevan. Journalists will travel throughout the
country or region that the project is taking place in - wherever the
story takes them. All travel and accommodation throughout the 10 days
will be covered by MDI. MDI will also provide travel to Yerevan where
needed to take part in the course. MDI will also provide a per diem of
$15 for each of the 10 days of the project. Knowledge of English
language isn't necessary (translation will be provided in both
languages), but Basic understanding of Russian is essential.",NA
